# Mathematical Morphology & Histogram Processing

This project contains a **Python Jupyter Notebook** focused on exploring **mathematical morphology** operations applied to digital images.
Through practical examples, different **structuring elements** are used to perform operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing, both on binary and grayscale images.

The work also includes **histogram manipulation exercises** to analyze how image processing methods affect the distribution of pixel intensities.

## üéØ Objectives

* Introduce the concept of a **structuring element** (disk, line, square, etc.).
* Apply morphological transformations:

  * Erosion
  * Dilation
  * Opening
  * Closing
* Compare results on binary and grayscale images.
* Study the impact of the **shape and size of the structuring element** on the output.
* Practice with histograms to link visual and statistical interpretation.
